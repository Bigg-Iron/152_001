# TODO: endangeredreport.py is a module that you must write to print a report for the different analyses.
# The file is very large so you should only read it once. It is expected that you will complete the analysis as you read the file and place the results in dictionaries during the init function. The other functions can simply return the dictionaries you created in the init function.
# You will be writing two modules. The modules should only define global variables and functions. The modules should not have a main or call any of their functions at the top level.

# TODO: status(): should take an analysis dictionary as a parameter and print the tabular report for each element in the dictionary, sorted alphabetically.
def status(report, analysis):
    
    pass
