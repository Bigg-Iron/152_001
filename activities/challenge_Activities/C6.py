''' 6.2.2: Basic while loop with user input.
Write an expression that executes the loop body as long as the user enters a non-negative number.

Note: If the submitted code has an infinite loop, the system will stop running the code after a few seconds and report "Program end never reached." The system doesn't print the test case that caused the reported message.

Sample outputs with inputs: 9 5 2 -1
Body
Body
Body
Done.

''' 6.2.3: Basic while loop expression.
Write a while loop that repeats while user_num â‰¥ 1. In each loop iteration, divide user_num by 2, then print user_num.

5.0
